[1] Open the cmd/command prompt.
[2] Now To Use the swapper simply follow this -> Usage: Swapper.exe <ucas-file> <hex-to-search> <hex-to-replace> 
BUT Replace <> with "" 
Example : Lets say you wanna replace 8C 00 with 8C 01 in pakchunk10-WindowsClient_s2.ucas you have to do this :

Swapper.exe "C:\Program Files\Epic Games\fortnite\fortnitegame\content\paks\pakchunk10-WindowsClient_s2.ucas" "8C 00" "8C 01"
 
And then simply press enter.


NOTE!
you have to drag the ucas file from the pak folder to the console. Sometimes the "" are already added by just dragging it so just make sure to double check it.
-> **THIS ONLY IMPLIES FOR THE UCAS FILE DRAGGING!**


Happy Swapping,
Sincerely Jim and mtbr.
