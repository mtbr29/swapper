**Tutorial**
1. Open the command prompt (cmd).
2. To use the swapper, follow these instructions: <br>
   Usage: Swapper.exe <ucas-file> <hex-to-search> <hex-to-replace> <br>
   However, replace the angle brackets (`<>`) with quotation marks (`""`).<br>
   For example, if you want to replace `8C 00` with `8C 01` in `pakchunk10-WindowsClient_s2.ucas`, you should enter the following command: <br>
<br>
   `Swapper.exe "C:\Program Files\Epic Games\fortnite\fortnitegame\content\paks\pakchunk10-WindowsClient_s2.ucas" "8C 00" "8C 01"`<br>
 <br>
   Then, simply press Enter.
<br><br>
**Note!**
<br>
You need to drag the `.ucas` file from the `pak` folder into the console. Sometimes the quotation marks (`""`) are added automatically when you drag the file, but make sure they are there. <br>
->
**This only applies when dragging the UCAS file!**

Happy Swapping and modding!<br>
Sincerely, Jim and mtbr.
